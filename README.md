## Explore Bikeshare Data with R

### Description
This project makes use of R to explore data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider as related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Through computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations,it aims to answer questions such as:
1. For the cities with data on birth year(Chicago and New York), what is the birth year distribution? Is there a popular age group?
2. Does gender influence the age of bikers? Which gender has the higher proportion of oldest and youngest bikers? Which gender has the most bikers?
3. What categories of people (in terms of age and sex) have the most trip duration in both Chicago and New York?

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities.
